# Hi There <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/824ef0a6-ca01-4bcd-86de-93876309fc4e" width="50">


I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, focusing on continuous learning and development throughout my academic journey.

During my undergraduate studies, I actively participated in innovative projects at Istanbul Medeniyet University's Field Robotics Lab, aiming to develop autonomous solutions for unmanned aerial and ground vehicles. Through these experiences, I built a strong foundation in control and robotics engineering, as well as in fields such as machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and software development.

In line with my career goals, I am committed to continuously improving myself in these areas and applying my knowledge to professional endeavors. My motivation and career aspirations are key elements that shape both my personal and professional development.
